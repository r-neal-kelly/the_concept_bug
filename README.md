# the_concept_bug
Just a showcase of a C++20 concept bug that causes me quite a bit of grief. It happens when you try to define out-of-body functions of a template specialization using concepts. Also, I present the best work around I've discovered so far. The comments in the source file go over all the details, including which compilers have the bug and to what extent.
